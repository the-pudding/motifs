It’s pretty subtle and probably not something a listener would discern, but a nice callback to the musical’s original source material."},{"type":"text","value":"~see the melodies side by side~"},{"type":"text","value":"What really makes this “unlimited” line iconic though, is that it repeats 3 times throughout the show, all at pivotal moments for the main character, Elphaba. Each time it’s repeated, it builds in emotional depth, subconsciously transporting you back to the earlier occurrences and prompting the audience to reflect on the change we’ve seen."},{"type":"text","value":"~viz of unlimited motif~"},{"type":"text","value":"This kind of thing happens in lots of art forms, from <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8HePfa7WYs&t=3s&ab_channel=Sideways target=_blank>film scores</a> to <a href=https://pudding.cool/2018/02/stand-up/ target=_blank>standup sets</a>. Depending on the medium, you might call it a theme, a callback, reincorporation. Repetition that creates structure and meaning."},{"type":"text","value":"Musically, the word <strong>motif</strong> describes a short, recurring musical idea, which could be melodic, rhythmic, or harmonic. Composers have been using this for forever. Think Beethoven’s 5th, where da-da-da-DUM repeats and reappears throughout the piece."},{"type":"text","value":"In the 19th century, German composers started formalizing the idea of attaching a motif to a person, place, or idea within a story (these specific kinds of motifs are referred to as leitmotifs). Think Peter and the Wolf, where different instruments and melodies represent different animals in the woods. Or the theme from Star Wars where you can tell that Darth Vader is coming by hearing that signature melody."},{"type":"text","value":"This creates a musical storytelling shortcut - you can convey story and emotional information without words, just music.

The musical is sung-through (like an opera), there is almost no spoken dialogue at all, different from Wicked, which has less than half as many songs separated by lots of spoken dialogue. So in Les Miserables, this musical structure does a lot to help the audience both understand and feel the emotional impact of the story."}]},{"section":"techniques","content":[{"type":"text","value":"Let’s look at some of the ways that Les Miserables uses motifs to convey information."}]}]}
